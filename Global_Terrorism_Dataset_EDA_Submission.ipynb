Maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland, the GTD is a critical resource for understanding global terrorism. The objective of this analysis is to explore and analyze the GTD to discover key findings related to terrorist activities, including trends, patterns, attack characteristics, geographic distribution, impacts, and profiles of perpetrators. The insights gained will inform and enhance counter-terrorism strategies and policies."
